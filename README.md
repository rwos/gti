Just a silly `git` launcher, basically. Inspired by `sl`.

Build and Install
-----------------

From a package system:
* [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gti)
* it's in ArchLinux' AUR as [gti-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gti-git/) and as [gti](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gti/)
* [Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-vcs/gti)
* [Nix/NixOS](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=gti&query=gti)
* [FreeBSD ports](http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/games/gti/)
* [OpenBSD ports](http://openports.se/games/gti)
* [Homebrew/MacOS X](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gti#default)
* [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/packages/summary/gti.html)

From source:

    $ make
    $ make install # as root, probably

or

    $ make prefix=~/.local install # as a user

The default install *prefix* is `/usr/bin`.

You can change the speed of the car at runtime via `GTI_SPEED`.
For example:

    $ GTI_SPEED=2000 gti push # default is 1000

Usage
-----

Try typing `git` really fast, on an unfamiliar keyboard.
